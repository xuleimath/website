# Getting Started

## Examples and Explanations 
To get started building with RISC Zero, take a look at these examples, which feature explanations and tutorials for code available in our GitHub repositories:

* [**Hello World in Rust**](examples/rust_starter.md) - Our starter project for the RISC Zero zkVM. If you're just getting started writing code for the zkVM, we recommend reading (and playing with) this repository.

* [**RISC Zero Battleship**](examples/battleship_rust_explainer.md) - To see a more complex use of the RISC Zero zkVM in action, take a look at this working Battleship game. Here, players use private game board states to track whether opponents have sunk their battleships.

* [**RISC Zero Digital Signatures**](examples/digital-signature.md) - In this example, you'll see how to verifiably sign code run inside the RISC Zero zkVM. This example features a post-quantum digital signature generated using only SHA-2 as a cryptographic primitive.

# Open Source Repositories

* [**Rust Crates**](https://github.com/risc0/risc0#rust-crates) - If you're a Rust user, you'll find RISC Zero crates here, ready to be included in your existing projects.

* [**Contribute to RISC Zero**](http://www.github.com/risc0/risc0) - If you're interested in how RISC Zero projects for the zkVM work, or curious about contributing to this project, come take a look at our main project repository.

# About STARKs

RISC Zero's receipts are generated using a zk-STARK: a *zero knowledge, scalable, transparent argument of knowledge.* 

STARKs are a highly technical process - an innovation in the world of zero-knowledge cryptography introduced by Eli Ben-Sasson et. al in 2018. In order to prove the integrity of a computation with a STARK, the prover arithmetizes the entire question. By encoding the execution trace into polynomials, the statement of computational integrity is reduced to a statement about polynomial division. 

## Documentation

To get started in making sense of the RISC Zero STARK, start with the [RISC Zero Proof System Sequence Diagram + IOP Description](../explainers/proof-system/proof-system-sequence-diagram.md) and the [Fibonacci Trace Validation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSJ1J5PcS2op_vrGtbK5Mif0gAN6wbAaTSWTHy2vuFtfbtqbI_dRqpalNamNjjUcyqD7hDPJRgI2cG-/pubhtml#) example.

# About Number Theoretic Transforms
Number theoretic transforms (`NTTs`) and inverse number theoretic transforms (`iNTTs`) are a mechanism for converting between a `coefficient representation` and an `evaluation representation` of a given polynomial. 

## Documentation
Implementation and documentation for NTTs and iNTTs is in the `risc0-zkp-core` [Rust crate](https://github.com/risc0/risc0#rust-crates).

## Basic Function
`NTTs` convert from `coefficient representation` to `evaluation representation`. 

>`NTT(coefficients,field)=evaluations`

`iNTTs` convert from `evaluation representation` to `coefficient representation`

>`iNTT(evaluations,field)=coefficients`

## Background
NTTs are a [finite field](about-finite-fields.md) analog to Fourier transforms. Fourier transforms, FFTs, DFTs and NTTs are various methods of transforming a function from **evaluation form** to **coefficient form**. 

### Coefficient Form 
An array $(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1})$ defines a degree $n-1$ polynomial, $f$, where $f(x)=a_0x^0+a_1x^1+\ldots,a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$

### Evaluation Form
When an array is written in evaluation form, there's an implicit choice $g\in\mathbb{F}_q$. 
> The powers of $g$ are used as an `indexing set` to form ordered pairs $(g^i,u_i)$. 

The polynomial associated with the array $(u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{n-1})$ is the unique polynomial $f$ such that the degree of $f$ is less than $n$ and $f(g^i)=u_i$.

This [DFT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl9TZanwbBk) and [FFT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8HeD-MUrjY) from UW professor Steve Brunton are brief and instructive. For visual intuition, we recommend Grant Sanderson's [3blue1brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) and [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8RkArhtCc4). To translate from FFTs to NTTs, replace the complex root of unity with a finite field root of unity. 

For a deeper look into the algorithm at both a software and hardware level, we recommend this [FFT video from Reducible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0). And here's [Vitalik's talk](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/05/12/fft.html) on FFTs/NTTs.
